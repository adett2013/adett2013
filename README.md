# Welcome to My Profile!

- My name is Arne Dettmer. I am a German front-end developer and I'm currently learning SQL and a bit of LUA to create Roblox games. I am certified in CSS by Mimo.org and I know not only how to create beautiful websites, but also how to make them user-friendly.

## About Me

- I am someone who learns the basics and then gains more knowledge by coding and doing.
- I learn with Mimo.
- I have worked on some big projects, but also many small ones.
- After learning SQL and LUA, I will continue learning JavaScript to create more interactive websites.

## My Focus

- At the moment, I am focusing on SQL, but also on LUA (to create stunning Roblox games in Roblox Studio).
- With SQL, I want to create and manage databases to improve my skills, but first, I will practice the basics in Mimo (my favorite coding app).

## My Next Projects

- I am trying to create more beautiful websites for myself and friends to continue learning by doing.
